# AlgorithmPracticeII

The individual sets up the basics for a genetically unique individual with byte based genetic material and mutable information. 

The Population class creates a grouping of individuals and methods to iterate and grab these individuals for tournament purposes 

The Algorithm class sets up a binary based crossover method for a tournament and based on competition sets up a solution 

The GA class is the implementation class in which the program is run

instructions on how to run the project: any setup/libraries, and instructions on how to run the code with screenshots of what it should look like when it runs.


This project was created and can be easily run using intelleJ
for infomation on how to download and run intelleJ
the community version is availible here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html
reference this video if you need help:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upQu_brz7OI

after intelleJ software is intalled
- clone the github repository
- after opening the files insure that the module is marked as active and that an output path is established
- to do so open project structure and mark the path to the out folder and your machine then apply changes

* to run the system just press the run button on the GA file
* If you wish to change the desired solution this can be edited in the GA solution when the file sets the genes.
